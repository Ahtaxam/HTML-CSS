		<p><strong>Harry potter series</strong></p>
		<p>
			Harry Potter was a series of books authored by one of the most eminent writers of our generation, J.K. Rowling. 
			These books showcase the wizarding world and its workings. J.K. Rowling has been so successful
			at weaving a picture of this world, that it feels real. Although the series contains seven books,
			I have a particular favourite.
			<br><br>
			 My favourite book from the series is The Goblet of fire.
			When I started reading the book, it caught my attention instantly. Even though I had read all
			the previous parts, none of the books caught my attention as this one did. It gave a larger 
			perspective into the wizarding world. One of the things which excite me the most about this 
			book is the introduction of the other wizard schools. The concept of the Tri-wizard
			tournament is one of the most brilliant pieces I have come across in the Harry Potter series.

In addition, this book also contains some of my favourite characters. The moment I read about Victor Krumâ€™s entry,
 I was star struck. The aura and personality of that character described by Rowling are simply brilliant. Further,
  it made me become a greater fan of the series.

<p><strong>What Harry Potter series touht me</strong></p>
<p>
	Even though the books are about the world of wizards and magic, 
	the Harry Potter series contains a lot of lessons for young people
	 to learn. Firstly, it teaches us the importance of friendship. 
	 I have read many books but never come across a friendship like 
	 that of Harry, Hermoine, and Ron. These three musketeers stuck 
	 together throughout the books and never gave up. It taught me 
	 the value of a good friend. 
	 <br><br>
	 Further, the series of Harry Potter 
	 taught me that no one is perfect. Everyone has good and evil inside 
	 them. We are the ones who choose what we wish to be. This helped me 
	 in making better choices and becoming a better human being. We see 
	 how the most flawed characters like Snape had goodness inside them. 
	 Similarly, how the nicest ones like Dumbledore had some bad traits.
	  This changed my perspective towards people and made me more considerate.

<p>
	Finally, these books gave me hope. They taught me the meaning of 
	hope and how there is light at the end of the tunnel.
	 It gave me the strength to cling on to hope in the most
	  desperate times just like Harry did all his life. These 
	  are some of the most essential things I learned from Harry Potter.

	In conclusion, while there were many movies made in the books.
	 Nothing beats the essence and originality of the books. The
	  details and inclusiveness of books cannot be replaced by any
	   form of media. Therefore, the Goblet of Fire remains to be my favourite book.
